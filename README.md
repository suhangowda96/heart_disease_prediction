Features
Predict heart disease risk based on patient data.
Utilize machine learning algorithms for accurate predictions.
Easy-to-use interface for data input and result display.

Technologies Used
Programming Languages: Python
Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
Machine Learning Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda

Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-prediction.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd heart-disease-prediction

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
python -m venv env

Activate the virtual environment:
On Windows:
bash
.\env\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
bash
source env/bin/activate

Install the required packages:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Prepare the Data: Place your dataset (data.csv) in the data/ directory.

Train the Model: Run the training script:
bash
python train_model.py

Predict: Use the following command to predict heart disease risk for new data:
bash
python predict.py --input data/new_patient.csv

Data
Source: Heart Disease UCI Dataset
Description: The dataset contains various health attributes including age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more.

Models
Logistic Regression: Used for binary classification of heart disease presence.
Decision Trees: For decision-making based on health metrics.
Random Forest: An ensemble method to improve prediction accuracy.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): For classification and regression tasks.

Results
The models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. You can view the results in results/ directory.
